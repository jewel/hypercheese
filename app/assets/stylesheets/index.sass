/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into index.css, which will
 * include all the files listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets, or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any,
 * can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file
 * per style scope.
 *
 * Note that we can't call this application.sass, because esbuild will create an
 * application.css in builds/ if we include any css in there.
